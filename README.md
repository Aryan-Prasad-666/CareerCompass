## Error Handling

The application includes comprehensive error handling:
- Validates input data
- Provides fallback responses if AI service fails
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes
- Includes detailed error messages for debugging

## Security Considerations

- Implements CORS for cross-origin requests
- API key should be stored securely in production
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Error messages are sanitized in production

## Development

The application runs in debug mode by default on port 5000. For production:
- Disable debug mode
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper logging
- Add rate limiting
- Set up proper CORS policies
